# 🚂 Ticket Bliss - Your Personal Java Train Ticket Booking Adventure!

Hey there! Welcome to **Ticket Bliss**, my little corner of the coding world where I've been diving deep into Java by building a (simulated) train ticket booking system. Think of it as my personal playground for learning — where trains run on code and tickets are just a few keystrokes away!

## 📌 What's This All About?

So, you've stumbled upon **Ticket Bliss**! This project is purely my journey into understanding Java better. I wanted to build something practical, something that has a few moving parts — and what's more relatable than booking a train ticket?

> ⚠️ **Heads up:** This isn't a real-world booking system (please don't try to book your next vacation here!). There's no fancy database, no complex security, and definitely no actual money involved. It's all about learning core Java and building logic from the ground up.

> It's all command-line magic for now, so get ready to type!
